#  tap-auth-micro-fe-react-app

This demo app was developed as PoC for an auth flow, which involves authencating a user using their Metamask wallet.

[`wagmi`](https://wagmi.sh/) is used to connect a user's wallet and sign a custom message.

[Moralis Auth API](https://docs.moralis.io/reference/auth-api-overview) is used to generate messages to sign, and verify user signatures.

This demo app serves as a companion micro-frontend React app to another Ionic/Angular app. The code for this app can be found here:<br>
